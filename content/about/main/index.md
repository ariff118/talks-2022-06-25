  Learn Statistical Data Analysis The Easy Way  
  
  Doing statistical analysis doesn’t have to be difficult and stressful. One has to understand the process and the critical ingredients of quality statistical analysis. The Website will help you learn how to conduct statistical analysis using some of the popular statistical software (open source and commercial) in the field of business and social sciences. Stats Talk With Kammy is a unique kind of casual and social get-together in culture, when you gather with friends and get to know each other better over some apéritifs, snacks, and anything in between. A good stats talk is one where you'd happily spend a few hours just hanging out.
  
  I hope this site helps me create my own virtual learning platform. A place where I and my site's visitors enjoy spending time, and one that helps folks get to know you better.
